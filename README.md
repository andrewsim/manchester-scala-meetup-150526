# Introduction to the Scala Type System

Scala is a statically, strongly typed language with built in type inference. Its type system allows us to do some pretty interesting stuff like Ad-Hoc Polymorphism, defining recursive type, programming at the type level and so on. The things that we will cover in this talk include but not limited to some basic types in Scala, the concept of variance and bounds and also Ad-Hoc polymorphism.
